IOC -> Phenomenon by which beans can be created and stored in IOC container

DI -> Retrieval of an already created bean from the IOC container (Dependency Injection)



ComponentScan ->
IOC -> Bean Creation -> IOC Container



2 pillars in SPRING

1. IOC (Creation Of Beans) -> @Component
2. DI (Retrieval Of Beans) -> @Autowired




Mac

How to read an annotation??

Annotations -> @Component, @RestController, @ResponseBody






Annotations like @Autowired enable spring to automatically inject dependencies without manually wiring

Reflections -> it is used to indentify fields annotated with these dependencies and to populate with respective dependencies
