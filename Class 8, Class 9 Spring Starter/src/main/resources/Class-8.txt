1. Maven
2. Embedded Server (Spring)
3. Spring Boot and framework
4. Rest API's

// Client -> Server


// Server -> API's (Contract)
//API -> Application Programming Interface

Architectural Style->
SOAP - Simple object access protocol
REST -> Representational State Transfer -> way of accessing web services in a simple way (without any processing)

CRUD ->
C -> Create
R -> Read
U -> Update
D -> Delete


Request Methods
1. GET -> Generally used for read operations i.e. operations should not change the data on server
2. POST -> Creating/writing new data
3. PUT -> Generally used for update operation (Employee data)
4. DELETE -> Generally used for deleting the data
5. Patch -> Sending few of the fields (few columns will be modified)



Server -> Servlet engine -> opening the sockets -> parsing the request (request params) [url] +




PostMan -> act as a client, testing for API's




Persistence -> DBase
Speed -> Cache (RAM)



Library Management System



Any running program is a process ->
CPU
RAM -> (64GB)
ROM(Hard disk) ->


// Path Variable / Request param

Request param -> https://localhost:8080/complete/search?name=random
Path variable -> https://localhost:8080/complete/search?name=random


You can't add have 2 api's with same name (in the entire application)


REST vs SOAP
Patch, Put, Delete
