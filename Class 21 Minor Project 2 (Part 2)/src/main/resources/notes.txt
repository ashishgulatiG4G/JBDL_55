Association / relationship

In JPA world, we can have two ways to represent this relationship

    1. Unidirectional association ->
        -> More workaround required to navigate between related classes, its faster

    2. Bidirectional association ->
        - It makes navigation easier, but will be slower compared to unidirectional

@JoinColumn -> Specifies the foreign key column

mappedBy -> Specifies the name of attribute in relationship owner entity
